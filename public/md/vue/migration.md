# Migration to Vue.js from Legacy

## Simple way
1. Copy static files to public folder
2. Test it
3. Commit

## Change html to Single file component such as *.vue


### Legacy JavaScript files
* Most functions are global function. Create `<script>` element and relate js file with `src` attribute and attach to `<head>` element for each.
